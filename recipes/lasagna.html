      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling
            boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, add the lasagna
            noodles a few at a time, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta
            uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked
            through, but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Remove the
            noodles to a plate.
          </p>

            noodles a few at a time, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta
            uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In a bowl, mix the cottage cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese until
            thoroughly combined.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Place 4 noodles side by side into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
            pan; top with a layer of the tomato-basil sauce, a layer of ground
            beef mixture, and a layer of the cottage cheese mixture. Repeat
            layers twice more, ending with a layer of sauce; sprinkle top with
            the mozzarella cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
          </p>
        </li>

            Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the
            cheese has melted, about 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake until
            cheese has begun to brown, about 10 more minutes. Allow to stand at
            least 10 minutes before serving.
